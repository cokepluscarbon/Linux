#26.process

所有的进程（process）都有一个唯一标识符，成为PID（Process Identifier）。同时，所有的进程都有一个PPID（Parent Process Identifier父进程标识符）。有一种例外情况就是init（或systemd）进程。init进程是用于启动所有的其他进程的，它的PID是1，没有PPID。init进程不能被杀手（任何尝试这样做的后果都是灾难性的）。



Everyprocess has a unique identifier called a Process Identifier(PID). Also, every process 
has a Parent Process Identifier(PPID). There is an exception, init(or systemd). The init
processstarts all other processes and has a PID of 1. This process is special because it 
cannot be killed (and any attempt to do so is often fatal).
Similar to files, a process also has access permissions. These are referred to as the Real user 
andGroup IDs. This provides a level of protection by not allowing unprivileged users to access 
critical operating system tasks. Memory, open files, and other resources are owned by the 
process and are kept separate from other processes (in most cases).

From the user’s perspective, a process is typically started from the command line or desktop. 
Take editing a file with vi, for example. The user starts the session and works interactively 
with the editor. He can save the file or edit another one. As long as the session is active, 
there is a PID associated with it. When the user terminates vi, the PID and all the associated 
resources are terminated as well. That PID will be recycled and used by the OS again later. 
A program run is this way is called a foreground process.
A process can also be run in the background. For example, in Chapter 4, Networking and the 
Internet, we ran the browser with the firefox &command. The ampersand puts the process 
into the background, freeing up that terminal for more input/output. Note that messages 
coming from the application (Firefox in this example) will still be output to that terminal. This 
can really be helpful when debugging. Also note that a process run in the background tends 
to run at a lower priority than a foreground task (more on priorities later). In the old days, 
background processes were also commonly referred to as jobs.
There are some special file handlesassociated with each process:
f Standard input(stdin): Aprocess takes its normal input from here (Handle 0)
f Standard output(stdout): Aprocess writes its normal output to here (Handle 1)
f Standard error(stderr): A process writes its error output to here (Handle 2)
The following is a screenshot showing the standard handles:

Other files opened by a process start at handle 3. There are some processes that have been 
given special names. For example, many of the processes on a Linux system are run in the 
background and, in most cases, are never meant to be run from the command line. These are 
called services or daemons. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon(HTTPD)web process 
is a good example of a service.

Typically, a service waits for an event or events to occur, performs an action or some actions, 
and then goes back to waiting again. If a service logs any activity, it will generally do so to 
the /var/log/<service-name>directory.
If the terminal a background job was started from is terminated, 
the background job will end as well. Some Linux distributions will 
attempt to warn the user of this condition.
