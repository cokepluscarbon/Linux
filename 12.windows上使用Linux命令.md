#12.windows上使用Linux命令

http://www.cygwin.com/ 
  
Cygwin is:

  * a collection of tools which provide a Linux look and feel environment for Windows.
  * a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API layer providing substantial Linux API functionality.
  
  
Cygwin is not:

  * a way to run native Linux apps on Windows. You must rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows.
  * a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of UNIX® functionality like signals, ptys, etc. Again, you need to build your apps from source if you want to take advantage of Cygwin functionality.
